# NFL-Salary
## Abstract:
A program that determines what variables and statistics are factored in to determine an NFL
Quarterback’s base salary. This project aspires to give insight to optimal spending on a team’s
Quarterback and getting value from what they spend. Every Quarterback’s personal and team
statistics from years 2005 to 2018 will be used to analyze how much value they had to the team
and will be compared to their salary to determine their value. Based on the findings, projected
value of the current (2019-20) Quarterback’s contract can be found as well as the optimal
spending for a new NFL team.
Problem and Motivation:
The data set was collected from multiple sources; the official NFL website, Spotrac, and football
outsiders. The NFL website provided the Quarterback’s statistics, spotrac provided the
Quarterback’s salary, and football outsiders provided every team’s offensive and defensive
rankings. The conclusions drawn from this project can provide NFL teams a guideline and
strategy to get another quarterback, or an amount to offer their current one.

## Data:
1. Player (the player’s name)
2. Team (the player’s team)
3. Comp (the number of completed passes)
4. Att (the number of attempted passes)
5. Yds (the number of passing yards)
6. TD (the number of touchdowns)
7. Int (the number of intercepted passes)
8. Rate (the quarterback rating)
9. Year (the year of the season they played)
10. Following Year (the following year of the season they played)
11. Following Salary (the player’s base salary of the following year)
12. Offensive Rank (the team’s offensive ranking for which the player plays for)
Questions of Interest:
Which Quarterback statistics are important to consider when determining their salary for
the following year? What type of Quarterbacks are getting overpaid or underpaid?

## Conclusion:
Based on my findings, the most important variables to consider when determining a
Quarterback’s base salary for the future are completed passes, attempted passes, yards,
touchdowns and rating. Since the quarterback rating uses these variables as well as interceptions
to be measured, rating is a strong predictor to use. The base salary is difficult to measure how
valuable a quarterback is because most contracts are for multiple years and there are many
factors such as injury and retirement that can affect the quarterback’s performance. By looking at
individual cases for each player, they generally follow that more touchdowns in a previous
season leads to a higher base salary. When a team is looking for a new quarterback, they should
be looking for someone who would accept a low base salary with the potential to have high
touchdowns. These players are generally rookies who have yet to prove their value but have the
potential to perform much higher than what they are paid for. In the end, the teams with the
higher offensive ranks are not those who pay the most for their quarterback but those who pay
well under for what their quarterback is worth.
